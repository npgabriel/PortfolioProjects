# PortfolioProjects

Amazon Web Scraping Project:

In this project I created a web scraper in JupyterNotebooks using BeautifulSoup and Pandas to get a product's 
name and price from an amazon page, and set up a periodic price check to send the data to a CSV file.

COVID Data Exploration and Dashboard:

In this project I used SQL in Azure Data Studio to explore multiple data sets involving COVID-19 mortality rates 
and vacination statictics. I then cleaned the COVID data set with SQL and created a dashboard with Tableau
to show some insights like the global COVID numbers, percent of population infected by country, total deaths per 
continent, and projected percent of population infected in select countries.

Movie Data Correlation with Python:

In this project I used JupyterNotebooks and popular Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and matplotlib to look 
for correlations between select variables and a movie's gross revenue.

Nashville Housing Data Cleaning:

In this project I took raw housing data for Nashville and used SQL in Azure Data Studio to transform the data
to make it more usable for analysis.
